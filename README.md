In 2023, I started learning **DevOps** and **Cloud Computing** in order to automate processes and flows. I am really passionate in solving emerging problems with my software skills and knowledge. 

- 💞️ Outside the world of tech, I love engaging in sporting activites (majorly football) and am also a gamer.
